	The goal of this small, but fun project will be to implement a basic type of program
capable of organizing and managing various types of recipes. At the core of the program, it will aim to be an efficient way to organize and manage recipes. It will allow the searching of recipes on a basic level, and allow the user to add and remove recipes as they see fit. On a more advanced level, the aim of the program would be to try and find efficient ways to print recipes that contain certain ingredients, complexities, and various other methods of sorting through them. It will not be a functionally impressive program, to say the least. However, the goal of this project will be to implement a clean, functional method that is efficient and does not rely too heavily on inefficient coding methods.

	This project will hopefully be a good exploration into time and memory allocation As it currently stands, these features are are the only planned features. These are subject to change as the project progresses. Regardless of features, the core of the projcet will remain a recipe database.
